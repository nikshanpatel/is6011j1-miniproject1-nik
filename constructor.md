11.	**Constructor:**

A constructor is a special kind of method that Python calls when it instantiates an object using the definitions found in your class. Python relies on the constructor to perform tasks such as initializing (assigning values to) any instance variables that the object will need when it starts.

In Python the __init__() method is called the constructor and is always called when an object is created.

Syntax of constructor declaration :

         def __init__(self):
               # body of the constructor

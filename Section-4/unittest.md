10. **Unit test:**

Unit Testing in Python is done to identify bugs early in the development stage of the application when bugs are less recurrent and less expensive to fix.

A unit test is a scripted code level test designed in Python to verify a small "unit" of functionality. Unit test is an object oriented framework based around test fixtures.

Python Unit Testing mainly involves testing a particular module without accessing any dependent code. Developers can use techniques like stubs and mocks to separate code into "units" and run unit level testing on the individual pieces.

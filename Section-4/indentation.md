1.	**How Python uses Indentation to control Flow:**

Python programs get structured through indentation, i.e. code blocks are defined by their indentation. This principle makes it easier to read and understand other people's Python code. 
All statements with the same distance to the right belong to the same block of code, i.e. the statements within a block line up vertically. The block ends at a line less indented or the end of the file. If a block has to be more deeply nested, it is simply indented further to the right.

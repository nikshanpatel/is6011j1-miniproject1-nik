6. **Static**

Static means, that the member is on a class level rather on the instance level. Static variables exist only in single instance per class and are not instantiated. If a static variable is changed in one instance of the class, the change will affect its value in all other instances.
Static methods donâ€™t refer to any instance of the class and can be called outside      of it. They also cannot access any non-static data members of the class for obvious reasons.

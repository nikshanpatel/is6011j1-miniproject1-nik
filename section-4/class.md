4. **Class:**

A class is a code template for creating objects. Objects have member variables and have behaviour associated with them. In python a class is created by the keyword class . 

To understand the meaning of classes we have to understand the built-in __init__() function.

All classes have a function called __init__(), which is always executed when the class is being initiated.

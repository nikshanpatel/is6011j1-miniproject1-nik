2.	**Donâ€™t repeat yourself:**
Don't repeat yourself (DRY, or sometimes do not repeat yourself) is a principle of software development aimed at reducing repetition of software patterns, replacing it with abstractions or using data normalization to avoid redundancy.
The DRY principle is stated as "Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system". The principle has been formulated by Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas in their book The Pragmatic Programmer. When the DRY principle is applied successfully, a modification of any single element of a system does not require a change in other logically unrelated elements. Additionally, elements that are logically related all change predictably and uniformly, and are thus kept in sync. 
If we cut and paste code to reuse it in various places, we may at some point realize our code contains an error and have to fix the error in all the places we pasted and used our code. Often times we forget to fix one of the pasted pieces of code and we will be confused why our code does not work.

3.	**Design Patterns from Gang of Four:**

Most programmers are faced with a number of recurring problems as they write object oriented code. In an attempt to standardize the solutions to these problems, four software engineers, during the 90’s, got together and identified the most common patterns of problems that occur in object oriented programming. Then they formulated model solutions to these common problems in a book called “Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software” aka “The Gang of Four (GoF)”. It is still the authoritative reference for everything relating to software design patterns.
In layman's terms, A Design Pattern describes a problem and a general approach to solving it.
If we use design patterns, our programs will be easily understandable and extensible by those who come after us.

Classification of Design Patterns:
1.	Creational Patterns: These are concerned with creating objects
2.	Structural Patterns: These patterns describe relationship between objects
3.	Behavioral Patterns: Interaction between different objects

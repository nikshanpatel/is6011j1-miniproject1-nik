## The difference between cloning and forking a repository on GitHub

**Forking**

A fork is a copy of a repository that allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project. A forked repository differs from a clone in that a connection exists between your fork and the original repository itself. In this way, your fork acts as a bridge between the original repository and your personal copy where you can contribute back to the original project using [Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests).

Forking a project is as easy as clicking the  **Fork**  button in the header of a repository. Once the process is complete, you'll be taken right to your the forked copy of the project so you can start collaborating!

Check out our  [help article](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) for more information about forking, including steps on how to keep your fork synced up with the original project.

Remote Add / Remove / Show

A copy of the original branch. When you clone a branch, that new branch is a remote, or clone. Remotes can talk to the origin branch, as well as other remotes for the repository, to make communication between working branches easier. 

How to use: In terminal, enter $ git remote add 'short name' <URL>, $ git remote rm 'short name', $ git remote show origin

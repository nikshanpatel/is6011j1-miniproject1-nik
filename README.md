# **Mini Project # 1 for IS 601-1J1 - Web Development** #

## **Project Overview**

For this project, we are required to explain how the usage of Git, Docker, automated testing, and continuous integration can improve the productivity and competitiveness of a company we work for. We are a team of 3 group members and we have broken the project into 3 sections. 

Each member is responsible for answering these 3 main key questions:

     1. What is it?
     2. Why do you do it?
     3. How do you do it?
